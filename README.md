# inverted_index_challenge
 Build an inverted index that gives, for every word, the list of documents it appears in.
 
 This is run on Apache Spark 2.4.5, 14BG memory - using python and pyspark
 
 To run the index yourself you will need to download the .txt data files found in the 'Data' folder for both the dictionary and tests, and change file paths to your own mount. 

An example csv output can be found in 'Data/output'
