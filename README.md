# inverted_index_challenge
 Build an inverted index that gives, for every word, the list of documents it appears in.
 
 This is run on Apache Spark 2.4.5, 14BG memory - using python and pyspark
 
 To run the index yourself you will need to download the .txt data files found in the 'data/txt_files' folder and the test files found 'data/test_files', and change file paths to your own or local file path. 

An example .csv output developed from this code can be found in 'Data/output'
