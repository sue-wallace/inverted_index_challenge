# inverted_index_challenge

 Task: Build an inverted index that gives, for every word, the list of documents it appears in.
 
 This has been developed within Databricks using Apache Spark 2.4.5 and RDD, 14BG memory (python and pyspark)
 
 To run the index yourself you will need to download the .txt data files found in the 'data/txt_files' folder and the test files found 'data/test_files', and change file paths to your own or local file path. 

An example .csv output developed from this code can be found in 'data/example_output'.
